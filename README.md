### Summary: 
This was my first JavaScript project.  I incorporated any knowledge I had in C++, referenced JavaScript MDN documents, and completed this project in my first
attempt at writing JavaScript syntax.  This was a rewarding experience, and is the first of many JavaScript projects I will build.  I utilized a simple html file containing spans
for updating the clock in JavaScript.  I utilized simplistic styling and formatting in CSS.
